### Descrtiption

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game reimplemented in **TypeScript** using **object-oriented programming** principles and the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making strategy used in artificial intelligence to determine the optimal move in a two-player game by considering all possible outcomes.

The game utilizes the minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the AI player.
